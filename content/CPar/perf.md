# Performance Engineering

### How
- Plan and code efficient algorithms & data structures
- Profiling & evaluating (through meausurements) the execution efficiency
- understanding the organization of a computer system (architecture)

### Where
- In sequential code with ILP
    - pipelining
    - supserscalar w/ out-of-order exec
    - vector processing
- In a memory hierarchy
    - multi-level caches (+ distributed memory)
- w/ support for thread parallelism
- w/ computing processors (GPUs)
