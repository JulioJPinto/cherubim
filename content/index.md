title: Júlio's Thoughts
---

This is a website dedicated to host things I find interesting, as well as most of the notes I took ~~I didn't take a lot of notes~~.

## About myself

My name is Júlio. I'm 20 years old and I'm currently on my last year of my Bachelors in Software Engineering @ University of Minho.
I'm a member of CeSIUM and a mentor at Coderdojo Braga.

I'm very passionate about Computer Graphics and Design. Hopefully, next year, I will be enrolling in a Masters in Software Engineering.

I decided to create this so I have a place to write my mind and dump some of my college stuff.


### College Stuff

I was by far the best student in college but here you can find some of my stuff.
