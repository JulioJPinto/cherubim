title: Júlio's Thoughts
---

This is a website dedicated to host the notes I took ~~I didn't take a lot of notes~~.

## About myself

My name is Júlio. I'm 20 years old and I'm currently on my last year of my Bachelors in Software Engineering @ University of Minho.
I'm a member of CeSIUM and a mentor at Coderdojo Braga.

I'm very passionate about Computer Graphics and Design. Hopefully, next year, I will be enrolling in a Masters in Software Engineering.

I decided to create this so I have a place to dump my college stuff.
